### Key Technical Demonstrations

This project successfully incorporates the following advanced CSS features:

| Feature | Implementation | Criterion Met |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Flexbox** | Used for the **Navigation Bar** and the **About Section** content alignment. | 
| **CSS Grid** | Used for structuring the **Skills Section** and **Projects List** into a modern, easy-to-read layout. | 
| **Responsive Design** | Achieved using a **Media Query** at **600px**, switching from a vertical (mobile) stack to a horizontal (desktop) layout. | 
| **Animations & Effects** | Implemented a color-changing **Keyframe Animation** on the main heading text and a smooth **Transition/Transform** effect on the submit button hover. | 
| **Relative Units** | Used `rem`, `%`, and `vh`/`vw` principles for scalable padding and font sizes. |

### 💻 How to View Responsiveness

1.  **Clone or Download** the repository files.
2.  Open the **`index.html`** file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3.  **Resize the browser window:**
    * **Large View:** Observe the Flexbox (side-by-side elements) and Grid (2-column skills/projects) layouts.
    * **Small View (Mobile):** Shrink the window below 600 pixels. The layout will **stack vertically** to ensure optimal readability on mobile phones.
