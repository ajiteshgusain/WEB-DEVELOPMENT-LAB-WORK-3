| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Flexbox** | Used for the **Navigation Bar** and the **About Section** content alignment. | 
| **CSS Grid** | Used for structuring the **Skills Section** and **Projects List** into a modern, easy-to-read layout. | 
| **Responsive Design** | Achieved using a **Media Query** at **600px**, switching from a vertical (mobile) stack to a horizontal (desktop) layout. |
